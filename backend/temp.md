❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` relies on global variables `a` and `b`. This makes the function unpredictable and hard to
maintain, as its behavior depends on the values of `a` and `b` in the global scope.
* ❌ The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` might not be numbers, which could lead to unexpected results or
errors.
* ❌ The function lacks documentation (comments) explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Adds two numbers together.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
throw new Error('Both arguments must be numbers.');
}
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making it self-contained and predictable.
* ✔ Added input validation to ensure both arguments are numbers, throwing an error if they are not.
* ✔ Includes a JSDoc-style comment to document the function's purpose, parameters, and return value, improving
readability and maintainability.
* ✔ It would also be possible to use Typescript to define types instead of JSDoc

Final Note:

The revised code addresses the issues of global variable reliance, lack of input validation, and missing documentation.
It is more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand. Always aim to write functions that are self-contained,
validate their inputs, and are well-documented.
